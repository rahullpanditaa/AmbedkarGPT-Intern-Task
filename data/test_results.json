In Document 2, he views the Hindu-Muslim problem as a problem of nationalities and suggests that the Hindus and Muslims are two nations with different religions, cultures, languages, and historical backgrounds. However, he does not explicitly discuss his personal views on religion in this context.\n\nIn contrast, Document 5 clearly shows Ambedkar's critical stance towards Hinduism, as he rejects the authority of the Vedas, denies the efficacy of prayers, discards the usefulness of gods, and emphasizes the law of Karma. He also seems to suggest a preference for Buddhism, stating that it is the only religion which the world can have if it is to become a society of free and equal men.\n\nIn both documents, Ambedkar does not express support for any traditional religious authority or practice, indicating a significant difference in his view on religion compared to mainstream Hinduism. However, it's important to note that these are two separate statements and the evolution of his views might have been influenced by various factors over time.",

However, there is a difference in the context of his education discourse between the two documents.\n\nIn Document 4, Ambedkar shares his personal experience of fighting for education despite facing numerous obstacles, emphasizing its role in empowering him to challenge social injustice. He specifically refers to the struggles faced by untouchables (also known as Dalits) in gaining access to education and their need to organize themselves to fight for their rights.\n\nIn Document 6, while Ambedkar's views on education are not directly mentioned, his discussions on constitutional remedies and the protection of minorities imply that education plays a crucial role in equipping individuals with the knowledge and understanding necessary to protect their rights and stand against tyranny.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in Document 6, Ambedkar also discusses his critique of Hinduism, emphasizing the law of Karma and rejecting the authority of the Vedas, gods, and prayers. These ideas may have indirect implications for his views on education, as they reflect his broader perspective on societal structures and the role of religious beliefs in shaping individuals' lives.\n\nOverall, Ambedkar's views on education in both documents underscore its transformative potential in liberating marginalized communities like the untouchables and protecting minority rights against majority tyranny. However, his critique of Hinduism in Document 6 suggests a more complex understanding of the role of education within the broader socio-religious context of Indian society during his time.",

      "ground_truth": "Annihilation of caste, organization, education, entering government services, and using political power.",
      "generated_answer": " Ambedkar proposes several solutions for the untouchables in Document 6:\n\n1. Fight for their rights: The untouchables must assertively demand and fight for their rights, which have been denied to them due to the caste system.\n\n2. Organize themselves: By organizing collectively, the untouchables can gain strength and effectively advocate for their rights and interests.\n\n3. Education: Education is crucial in empowering the untouchables and helping them achieve their rightful place in society. This includes both formal education and self-education about their history and culture.\n\n4. Enter government services: By gaining access to government jobs, the untouchables can secure a stable income and improve their social status.\n\n5. Use political power: Political power is essential for protecting the interests of the untouchables, as their emancipation is impossible without it. This means participating in politics at various levels and using their collective influence to bring about change.\n\n6. Destroy belief in the sanctity of scriptures: Ambedkar suggests that the real remedy lies in challenging and overthrowing the authority of the shastras (scriptures) that support the caste system. This includes stopping the practice of caste or ceasing to believe in the shastras, as both are impossible to have simultaneously.\n\nOverall, Ambedkar's proposed solutions revolve around empowerment, self-organization, education, and political action, as well as challenging the religious and social norms that perpetuate the oppression of the untouchables.",

In both documents, Ambedkar criticizes ritualism, condemns the performance of sacrifices, rejects the authority of the Vedas, and denies the efficacy of prayers. However, in Document 2, these statements seem to be part of a broader criticism of Hindu religion without explicitly advocating for another specific religion.\n\nIn contrast, Document 5 suggests that Ambedkar views Buddhism as the only religion that could potentially foster a society of free and equal men. This shift indicates a more definite position towards religion, where he now advocates for a specific religious ideology (Buddhism) over others (such as Hinduism). Furthermore, in Document 5, Ambedkar also discusses the protection of minorities' rights under the Indian Constitution, which can be interpreted as an attempt to establish religious equality and fairness in society.\n\nSo, in summary, Ambedkar's view on religion differs between Documents 2 and 5 because he explicitly endorses Buddhism in Document 5, whereas in Document 2, his criticisms of Hindu religion are not accompanied by an endorsement of any specific alternative religious ideology.",

Fight for rights: He emphasizes the importance of the untouchables organizing themselves to fight for their rights, as political power is crucial for their emancipation.\n\n3.

Entering government services: He encourages the untouchables to seek employment in government positions to secure better opportunities and protect their interests.\n\n5. Constitutional remedies: Ambedkar suggests that the Constitution should include fundamental rights such as the right to equality, freedom, and constitutional remedies to protect minorities from the tyranny of the majority.\n\n6. Destroying belief in the sanctity of the shastras (scriptures): He argues that the problem of caste is rooted in the belief in the scriptures and that it cannot be solved without challenging this belief.\n\nIn summary, Ambedkar's proposed solutions for the untouchables focus on political organization, education, entering government services, constitutional protections, and challenging the authority of the shastras to address the issue of untouchability and caste discrimination.",

      "ground_truth": "Education is essential for both personal liberation from oppression and political empowerment for social change.",
      "generated_answer": " In Ambedkar's philosophy, education and liberation are closely intertwined. He believes that education is the key to liberation for the untouchables (a class he refers to as originally inhabiting India and subjugated by invading Aryans). Education empowers them to fight against injustice, organize themselves, enter government services, use political power to protect their interests, and ultimately achieve emancipation. This is part of his vision for a society based on liberty, equality, and fraternity, which can only be realized through the abolition of caste.",

The fundamental rights must include the right to equality, the right to \nfreedom, the right against exploitation, and the right to constitutional remedies. These rights are necessary to protect the \nminorities against the tyranny of the majority. \nThe Constitution is not a mere lawyers' document. It is a vehicle of life, and its spirit is always the spirit of age. The Constitution \nmust provide for economic democracy as well as political democracy. Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base \nof it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality, and fraternity \nas the principles of life."

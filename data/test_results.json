      "ground_truth": "Fundamentally a problem of nationalities, not just communities, with two separate nations wanting separate homelands.",
      "generated_answer": " In Document 5, Ambedkar characterizes the Hindu-Muslim problem as a problem of nationalities, stating that Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations with different religions, cultures, languages, and historical backgrounds. He suggests that the Muslims have a strong desire for their own homeland and national state, which they cannot achieve under Hindu domination. Therefore, he considers the creation of Pakistan as inevitable and the only solution to the problem, as he believes that India's unity is artificial and was created by the British.",
